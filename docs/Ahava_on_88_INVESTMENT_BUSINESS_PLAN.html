  <p class="subtitle">AI-powered home healthcare platform for South Africa</p>

  <h2>1. Cover and Executive Summary</h2>
  <h3>Title</h3>
  <p>Ahava Healthcare (on 88) – Investment Business Plan</p>
  <h3>Subtitle</h3>
  <p>AI-powered home healthcare platform for South Africa</p>
  <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
  <p><strong>Problem.</strong> South Africa faces constrained access to quality primary care, overcrowded facilities, and a growing need for home-based care and triage. Patients struggle to book visits, coordinate with nurses, and get timely oversight from doctors. Care is fragmented and payment options are limited.</p>
  <p><strong>Solution.</strong> Ahava Healthcare is a single platform that connects patients with qualified nurses for home visits, provides doctor oversight for quality assurance, and adds AI-assisted triage using symptoms, medical images, and biometric data. Patients book visits, pay by card or insurance (Paystack), and receive care with full visibility for clinicians. All AI output is reviewed by licensed professionals (human-in-the-loop).</p>
  <p><strong>Market.</strong> The platform is built for South Africa: timezone (Africa/Johannesburg), currency (ZAR), and alignment with local healthcare guidelines (NDOH, EML). Target segments include primary care, chronic care, and post-discharge follow-up.</p>
  <p><strong>Traction.</strong> The platform is built and production-ready: backend API (Express, PostgreSQL, Prisma), unified Next.js web app (Patient, Nurse, Doctor, Admin dashboards), Paystack integration, AI triage (Google Gemini), and deployment configs for Railway, Render, and Fly.io. Pre-launch checklist items (production env, DB backups, monitoring) are documented and addressable.</p>

  <h2>2. Business Case</h2>
  <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Access to quality primary care in South Africa is limited; facilities are overburdened.</li>
    <li>Home-based care and nurse-led visits are underused due to coordination and trust frictions.</li>
    <li>Triage and symptom assessment are often delayed or inconsistent.</li>
    <li>Payment and insurance claims add administrative load for providers and patients.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Solution</h3>
  <p>Ahava delivers one integrated platform:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Patient booking:</strong> Scheduling of home healthcare visits with address, date, duration, and payment method (card or insurance).</li>
    <li><strong>Nurse operations:</strong> Real-time visit management, GPS-based assignment, status updates (scheduled, en route, arrived, in progress, completed), and in-app messaging.</li>
    <li><strong>Doctor oversight:</strong> Review and approval of visits, review of AI triage cases (approve, override, or refer), and quality assurance.</li>
    <li><strong>AI-assisted triage:</strong> Patients submit symptoms, optional medical images (e.g. X-ray, dermatology), and biometric data. Google Gemini powers preliminary analysis; cases are routed by specialty and priority. All outputs are reviewed by a doctor or nurse before release.</li>
    <li><strong>Payments:</strong> Paystack for card payments and insurance claim processing; payment status and refunds tracked in-platform.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Market</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Geography:</strong> South Africa first; design supports local compliance (POPIA) and healthcare norms.</li>
    <li><strong>Segments:</strong> Primary care, chronic disease management, post-discharge follow-up, and home-based nursing.</li>
    <li><strong>Regulatory context:</strong> Alignment with NDOH/EML and clinical guidelines; human oversight of AI to support safe, accountable care.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Revenue Model</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Booking and visit fees:</strong> Revenue from completed home visits (patient or insurer pays).</li>
    <li><strong>Paystack:</strong> Transaction flow for card payments; platform can retain a margin or pass-through per commercial agreement.</li>
    <li><strong>Insurance:</strong> Insurance claim processing and verification (CARD and INSURANCE payment methods in-platform).</li>
    <li><strong>AI triage (optional):</strong> Specialty- and priority-based pricing in ZAR (e.g. Nursing R500 base, General Practice R800, Cardiology R2,000, Emergency R3,000; adjusted by priority: LOW 0.8x, MEDIUM 1x, HIGH 1.3x, URGENT 1.5x). Examples: skin rash (Dermatology, LOW) ~R960; chest pain (Cardiology, URGENT) ~R3,000.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Competitive Edge</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Integration:</strong> Combined home visits, doctor oversight, and AI triage in one product (no separate triage and visit tools).</li>
    <li><strong>South Africa–first:</strong> Built for SA timezone, language (en-ZA), currency (ZAR), and guideline alignment.</li>
    <li><strong>Human-in-the-loop:</strong> AI supports clinicians; every triage output is reviewed before release to the patient.</li>
  </ul>

    <li><strong>Evolving regulation:</strong> Mitigation: stay abreast of POPIA and healthcare authority guidance; design for data portability and retention policies.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Operational</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Nurse and doctor availability:</strong> Mitigation: verification and onboarding; clear assignment and queue management; escalation paths.</li>
    <li><strong>Quality of care:</strong> Mitigation: doctor oversight of visits and triage; structured review and release workflow; feedback and incident handling.</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h2>7. Team and Next Steps</h2>
  <h3>Team</h3>
  <p>Ahava is structured for lean, startup-friendly execution. The team combines technical leadership (full-stack, backend, frontend), operations and general management (scheduling, support, partners), and clinical leadership (medical oversight, guideline alignment, and AI-review policy). Roles can be combined or expanded as the company scales. A dedicated team structure document can outline exact roles and hiring plan.</p>
  <h3>Next Steps</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Launch checklist:</strong> Complete production environment variables (JWT, encryption, Paystack production, DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL); run production migrations; enable database backups; configure CORS and monitoring; deploy frontend (e.g. from <code>workspace</code>) and point to production API.</li>
    <li><strong>First pilots:</strong> Run controlled pilots with a small set of patients, nurses, and doctors; validate booking-to-visit flow, payments, and triage review; gather feedback.</li>
    <li><strong>Metrics:</strong> Define and track KPIs (e.g. bookings per week, visit completion rate, payment success rate, triage review time, user satisfaction) and iterate on product and operations.</li>
